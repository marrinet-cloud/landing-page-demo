this is my first webpage ever built. it was made using vs code and can be viewed using live server. this landing page project is a fun way to showcase what i've learned in the html and css modules.
the projects aren't real projects, and the links aren't active, but this project helped me practice the layout of a webpage and styling the components in different ways using css.
i hope you enjoy
